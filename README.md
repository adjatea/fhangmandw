## Instructions
You can either play this game by clicking on the buttons representing the alphabet or by using the keyboard. The goal is to guess as many secret words as possible. To achieve this you have to choose wisely the right letters. Wrong letter choices will punish you and disable the specific letter button until you complete the word or get a new one.
